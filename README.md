# Simulation of interferometer characterization

Matlab code for simulation to test accuracy and precision of interferometer characterization 

---

This repository comprises Matlab code for the characterization procedure presented in article ["Accurate and precise characterization of linear optical interferometers"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00283) by Ish Dhand, Abdullah Khalid, He Lu, Barry C. Sanders. Plots in the manuscripts are baed on simulations IsCalibrationUseful.m and GaussianVersusNonGaussian.m. Data output from these simulation procedures is in the folder DataSets.

If you use this code to characterize an interferometer, please drop [me](http://ishdhand.me/)  an email at [ishdhand@gmail.com](ishdhand@gmail.com). Comments, suggestions and bug-reports are welcome.
